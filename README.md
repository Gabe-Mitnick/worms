# worms
A hypnotizing sea of random worms on the HTML5 canvas. Click or press space to generate a new set of parameters. Inspired by [Matt DesLauriers](https://www.mattdesl.com/)' [color-wander](http://color-wander.surge.sh/).

### TODO
Adjust speed based on framerate, since each individual client runs the animation loop as fast as it wants.
